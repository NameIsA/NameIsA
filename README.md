  <summary>🌟 About</summary>
  
 I'm a collaborator on the ProdigyMathGameHacking repository.

 I can code in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and C#, and I've been into web development for about 3 years now.
 
 I commonly give opinions on things such as privacy, security, etc. I believe that cybercrime would be much less frequent if people took precuations for their own security.
