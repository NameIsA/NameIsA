### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm some idiot who breaks things.

I can code in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and C#. I've also expiremented with other languages, such as Python, Lua, Java, and others.

I am mainly interested in cybersecurity and web development.

Reach me at the email listed on my profile (You'll have to be signed in to see it)
