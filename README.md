### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm some idiot who breaks things.

I can code in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and C#. I've also expiremented with other languages, such as Python, Lua, Java, and others.

I am mainly interested in cybersecurity and web development.

Reach me at swxtchcodeREMOVE@protonmail.com (remove the text saying "REMOVE")
